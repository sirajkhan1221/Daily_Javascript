# Daily JavaScript Practice 🚀

This repository contains a collection of daily JavaScript coding problems that I practice to enhance my programming skills and deepen my understanding of JavaScript concepts. 💪

# Problem Solving Approach 💡

Each day, I tackle a new problem and strive to find an optimal solution. I follow these steps when approaching a problem:

1. Understanding 🔎: I carefully read and understand the problem statement or requirements.
2. Plan 📝: I formulate a plan or algorithm to solve the problem. This may involve breaking the problem down into smaller subproblems.
3. Implementation 💻: I write clean, readable, and efficient code to solve the problem.
4. Testing 🧪: I thoroughly test the code with different test cases to ensure its correctness.
5. Optimization ⚡: If necessary, I optimize the code for better performance or clarity.
6. Documentation 📖: I document the problem, solution approach, and any noteworthy insights in the code comments.

# Structure 📂

The repository is organized into different directories, each representing a specific day of practice. Within each directory, you'll find:

- A JavaScript file containing the problem statement and my solution code.
- Additional files, if necessary, such as test cases or supporting resources.

# Usage 🚀

Feel free to explore the repository and use it as a resource for your own JavaScript practice. You can navigate to a specific day's directory to view the problem statement and solution code. If you'd like, you can also contribute your own solutions or suggest improvements to existing solutions through pull requests.

# Acknowledgments 🙏

I would like to acknowledge the sources of these daily problems, such as coding challenge websites, online tutorials, or programming books, which have greatly contributed to my learning journey.
